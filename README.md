# 100 Days

Released to the Google Play store and iOS App Store as Hundred Habits.

A React Native mobile app that helps you get better at a task / develop a habit with the Law of 100 principle.

The Law of 100 is a commitment to a task or goal for 100 iterations or days. It's about doing something consistently, without fail, 100 times. This approach taps into the power of habit formation and perseverance. It's not just about reaching a numerical milestone; it's about the journey and transformation that occurs along the way.
